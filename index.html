               <h2>Keep the toddlers active and busy in nature! </h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">To start with, we all know that toddlers like staying active. 
                  If they are kept busy with enjoyable activities, they become happy. 
                  Otherwise, it gets very difficult to look after this age group, 
                  especially if you have an energetic one like mine. </p>
               <p>I have a 2-year-old son. Although I worked as a teacher until I came to the USA,
                   I did not consider working here. There are a few reasons that lie behind my decision, 
                   one of which is to see my baby grow up by observing him reach his milestones and 
                   I think I will not regret it because it is a great joy for me to spend my nearly whole day with him. 
               </p>
               <p>On my page, I want to tell you about a few of our outdoor activities that we enjoy doing together as a family!</p>

               <h2> Gardening</h2>
               <p>The first one we like is gardening. This year, we reserved two spots in the community garden of our 
                  apartment complex. We did all the steps together with him, removing the weeds, planting the vegetables 
                  and watering the garden together every evening. I can say that he is a very good gardener and he enjoys
                   seeing the changes, like the vegetable blossoms and the vegetables that are growing on the plants.
                    I am sure he is also learning that we need to be patient and spend effort for the good things in life.
                     He is looking forward to eating the first cucumber in our garden!

               <h2>Visiting the farms</h2>
               <p>Another activity that we love is going to the farms and feeding the animals there. 
                  Our favorite one is the one in Suson Park. He loves feeding them there and 
                  I like the smile on his face while patting the animals. We have learnt all the horsesâ€™ 
                  names and started to learn the names of others and talk about them using their names!</p>

            <section>
               <a name ="Storybook walks"></a>
               <h2>Storybook walks</h2>
               <p>In addition, we love Kirkwood Park. There are many activities that we can do there. 
                  My son loves the storybook that is spreaded on the walking trail. Normally, he gets 
                  really tired while walking but he loves walking there, actually he runs between the pages. 
                  He loves the stories and becomes eager to walk on the walking trail to be able to read the books. 
                  In this way, we can enjoy walking as well as reading. </p>

               <a name ="Playing in the sand "></a>
               <h2>Playing in the sand </h2>
               <p>The last one I want to mention is playing in the sand in the parks. Parks are great places 
               to get together especially when the weather is nice. While we are drinking our tea and coffee,
                our babies can enjoy the sand by making sand castles, which is another great way for the children to 
                use his energy. Thankfully, Saint Louis offers great opportunities for us to spend our time meaningfully 
                by being in nature. I want to make use of these places and help my child feel that we can be happy 
                when we are active and observe nature as much as we can. </p>
